# Minesweeper with GUI in Python
A mate needed help to make a GUI for the minesweeper game described in [this](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/create-minesweeper-using-python) tutorial.
Full code is also in the tutor's [repository](https://github.com/Aprataksh/Minesweeper/blob/master/minesweeper.py).

I came up with how the GUI would integrate with the original code and my mate helped find useful snippets I requested for.

This repo was first created as private to avoid any plagiarism software from finding my github; hence the abscence of a detailed commit history.
